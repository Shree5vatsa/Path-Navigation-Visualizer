# PathAlgo-Navigator

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PathAlgo-Navigator â€” a project I built to make learning pathfinding and maze algorithms fun, visual, and interactive. If you've ever wondered how algorithms like Dijkstra or A* actually work, or just want to play with mazes, you're in the right place!

What does it do?

This is a web app where you can:
- Watch popular pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS) solve a grid in real time.
- Generate cool mazes with a click (Binary Tree and Recursive Division styles).
- Play around: add or remove walls, drag the start/end points, and see how the algorithms react.
- Change animation speed to slow things down or speed them up.
- Get instant feedback with toasts and a handy legend so you always know what's happening.

It's all built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, so it's fast and looks good on any device.

Getting Started

Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shree5vatsa/Path-Navigation-Visualizer
cd Path-Navigation-Visualizer
npm install
```

Running the App

For development, just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To see a production build preview:
```bash
npm run preview
```

Open your browser to the local address it gives you, and you're set!

Usage

Here's how you can have fun with it:

1. Pick a Maze: Choose a maze type and hit "Generate Maze" to fill the grid with obstacles.
2. Choose an Algorithm & Speed: Select which pathfinding algorithm you want to see, and how fast you want the animation.
3. Start the Show: Click "Start" and watch the algorithm do its thing!
4. Interact: Drag on the grid to add or remove walls, or move the start/end points to see how the path changes.
5. Reset: Use "Clear Path" to remove just the path, or "Clear Grid" to wipe everything and start fresh.

What's Inside?

Pathfinding Algorithms
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path, guaranteed.
- A* Search: Like Dijkstra, but a bit smarter with heuristics.
- Breadth First Search (BFS): Explores layer by layer.
- Depth First Search (DFS): Dives deep before backtracking.

Maze Generation
- Binary Tree: Simple, fast, and creates interesting patterns.
- Recursive Division: Splits the grid with walls and leaves random gaps for paths.

Want to Add Your Own Algorithm or Maze?

I made it easy to extend! If you want to add a new pathfinding algorithm:
- Drop your code in src/lib/algo/pathnavigating/ and register it in src/utils/constants.ts.

For new maze generators:
- Add your maze logic to src/lib/algo/maze/ and register it in src/utils/constants.ts.

If you do something cool, let me know â€” I'd love to see it!
